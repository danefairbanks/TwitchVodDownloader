# TwitchVodDownloader

Important, need to get your twitch token via inspector.  You can get a token by going to twitch in chrome.
While logged in press f12. Go to the **console** tab, and at the cursor type in:

**cookies["auth-token"]**

***AUTH TOKENS ARE LIKE PASSWORDS DO NOT POST ANYWHERE***

This will give you the token. Refer to the image below:

Tool to download your own vods.  Will download them in raw .ts format. VLC maybe able to play these, use a videoconverter of choice to convert to other formats like .mp4.  Will download 30 at a time (more if you want to recompile for your purposes)
